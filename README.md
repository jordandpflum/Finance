# Motivation
While enrolled in the MSBA program at the University of Texas at Austin, a group of student's in the program's Financial Analytics Track wanted to explore and apply concepts they learned in class to real data. Thus, the group routinely formulate code (primarily Python) to implement taught theories and test them on real data to further understand the intricacies and possible limitations of the concept.

# Sections

## Na√Øve Diversification

An idea was introduced in a lecture which stated that even Naive Diversification - simply picking securities at random - of a Portfolio would lead to (on average) would decrease the variance of the expected return on the portfolio (ie less risk). Initially surprised by this statement, we sought to prove this statement empirically. See results and report [HERE](https://github.com/jordandpflum/Finance/tree/master/Diversification).

## Mean Variance Optimization - Market Portfolio Allocation

A section of the fall semester was devoted to exploring the optimization of a market portfolio - a concept known as Mean Variance Optimization - which shortly put is the process of determining the optimal allocation of resources between risk-free securities and any portfolio in order to minimize its risk while maintain a desired level of return . Although the course eventually focused on its implementation in Excel, the ability to write the algorithm in vector notation made it an ideal candidate to be written efficiently as a program, which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/jordandpflum/Finance/tree/master/MeanVarianceOptimization_MarketPortfolioAllocation).
