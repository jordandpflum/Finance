# Motivation
While enrolled in the MSBA program at the University of Texas at Austin, a group of student's in the program's Finacial Analytics Track wanted to explore and apply concepts they learned in class to real data. Thus, the group routinely formulate code (primarily Python) to impiment taught theories and test them on real data to further understand the intricacies and possible limitations of the concept.
